Sprint Planning:

The application needs atleast 3 sprints for 15 minutes each.
In first sprint developers can decide the flow of the application and what functionalities to be given
In Second sprint, we can discuss further on how to divide the application in small units (like add, listing of files, delete, search and exit application)
In third sprint, the dicussion will be over on what algorithm to use for listing files, taking input from user on add, delete and search file
